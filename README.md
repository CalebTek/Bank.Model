Title: Basic Bank Management System in .NET (C#)

Description:
Welcome to the Basic Bank Management System, a .NET (C#) application designed to provide a fundamental understanding of bank operations and transactions. This project focuses on essential banking features, offering users the ability to create accounts, log in securely, perform transactions, and access account information.

Features:

1. **Create Account**: New users can register by providing essential information such as name, email, and password. The system will generate a unique account number.

2. **Login**: Registered users can securely log in using their account number and password, ensuring privacy and data protection.

3. **Deposit**: Account holders can make deposits into their accounts, increasing their balance. The system records the transaction details for future reference.

4. **Withdrawal**: Users can initiate withdrawals from their accounts, reducing the balance. The system ensures sufficient funds are available before processing the transaction.

5. **Transfer**: Account holders can transfer funds between their accounts or to other users' accounts within the system. The transfer includes detailed transaction records.

6. **Check Balance**: Users can easily view the current balance of their accounts, helping them stay informed about their financial status.

7. **Print Account Statement**: Account holders can request and print a comprehensive account statement containing transaction history and current balance information.

Project Structure:

- **Account Management**: Create a mechanism for generating account numbers, maintaining account balances, and tracking transactions.

- **Transaction Handling**: Develop modules to process deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while ensuring data integrity and balance validation.

- **Balance Inquiry**: Enable users to check their account balances instantly.

- **Statement Generation**: Design a process to generate printable account statements with transaction details.

- **GUI Interface**: Build an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using WPF or WinForms, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the application.

- **Data Persistence**: Utilize a local database (e.g., SQLite) to store user information, account details, and transaction history.

- **Documentation and Usage Guide**: Provide detailed documentation on setting up the project, running the application, and utilizing each feature effectively.

- **Contributions**: Encourage community contributions through clear guidelines for issue reporting, feature enhancement, and code submissions.
